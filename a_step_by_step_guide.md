## 1. Requirement Clarification
  - **ask questions about the exact scope of the problem and clarify the ambiguities, in order to define end goals of the system**, because SD problems are mostly open-ended and they do not have ONE answer.
  - **clarify what part of the system we will be focusing on**, because we only have 35~40 minutes to design a (supposedly) large system.
