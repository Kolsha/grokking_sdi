## CAP Theorem

**1. Background**  
How can a distributed system **model itself to get the maximum benefits out of different resources available** (such as servers crash/fail permanently, or disks go bad, or network connection is lost) ?

**2. CAP Theorem**
- **Consistency (C)**: All users see the same data at the same time (i.e. users can read or write from/to any node in the system and receive the same data).
- **Availability (A)**: Every request received by a non-failing node in the system _must result in a response_. In simple terms, **availability refers to a system's ability to remain accessible even if one or more nodes in the system go down**.
- **Partition tolerance (P)**:
    - What is **partition** ?: a communication break (or network failure) between any 2 nodes in the systemã€‚
    - **What is partition tolerance system ?**: system continues to operate even if there are partitions in the system.

**3. Why CA is not a really coherent option ?**
- If a system is CA, that means the system cannot be P.
- If a system cannot be P, this system will be forced to either give up C or A.
  -  say partition_1 and partition_2 are disconnected;
  -  a write to parition_1 will not be able to update partion_2;
  -  therefore, user_a who reads partition_1 and user_b who reads partition_2 will see different data (this breaks consistency);
  -  if you want user_a and user_b both read data from parition_1 to keep consistency, your system is not 100% availability.

**4. In real world, we try to keep our system CP or AP**
- in the presence of partition, a distributed system must choose either C or A; and
- we cannot avoid parition happening in the system. Therefore, we always need to handle P(i.e. make our system P).
